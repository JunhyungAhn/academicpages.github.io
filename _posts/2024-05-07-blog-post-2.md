In order to learn Natural Language Processing, I took the online lecture ["CS224N: CS224N: Natural Language with Deep Learning"](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/), organized by Prof. Chris Manning, and created a summary for each lecture in this [notion page](https://www.notion.so/CS224N-Natural-Language-with-Deep-Learning-ab96bbeb868a4f228925f2548ce0b8c2).
