In order to learn Graph Neural Network, I took the online lecture ["CS224W: Machine Learning with Graphs"](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/), organized by Prof. Jure Leskovec, and created a summary for each lecture in this [notion page](https://www.notion.so/CS224W-Machine-Learning-with-Graphs-f3099e7ac1db4e0ea237a1ef7728a60c).
