In order to learn Causal machine learning, I studied ["Causal Inference for the Brave and True"](https://matheusfacure.github.io/python-causality-handbook/landing-page.html) and ["Introduction to Causal Inference"](https://www.bradyneal.com/causal-inference-course), written and organized by Matheus Facure Nubank and Brady Neal, respectively. 
I created a summary for each section in this [notion page](https://www.notion.so/Causal-Inference-60003ba1b4de4033815372cf6f2ee78a).
